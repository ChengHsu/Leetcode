In any sliding window based problem we have two pointers. 
One right pointer whose job is to expand the current window
and then we have the left pointer whose job is to contract a given window. 
At any point in time only one of these pointers move and the other one remains fixed.

Same Template:
- 904.Fruit into baskets 
- 159.Longest Substring with At Most 2 Distinct Characters 
- 340.Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters

Need to re-do:
- 76 Minimum Window Substring
- 395 Longest Substring with At Least K Repeating Characters
